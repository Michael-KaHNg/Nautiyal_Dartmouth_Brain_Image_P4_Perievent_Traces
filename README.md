# For Plotting Perievent Traces and Basic Statistical Comparsions

We have an output file from [Nautiyal_Dartmouth_Brain_Image_P3_Perievent_Analysis]
(_Avg_Cell_Traces_zNorm_Signal_||All_Trials||_|5s_bfr_Trial_Initi_End|-|5s_aft_Trial_Initi_End|_filtered_behav_added-DS1122-P6_3-S1-Sucrose-Reduced)

In this example, we are using that output file to plot time series data for cells that 

1. show excitation to both trial initiation and delay period (code:  AT+_AD+) and
2. showed no response to both trial initiation and delay period (code:  AT0_AD0)

On top right, it shows timepoint-by-timepoint unpaired permutation comparsions (alpha = 0.05) between the two cell types.

On bottom right, it performs an unpaired permutation to examine differences in area under curve between the two cell types.
