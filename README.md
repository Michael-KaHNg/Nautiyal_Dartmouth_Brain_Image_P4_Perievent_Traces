# For Plotting Perievent Traces and Basic Statistical Comparsions

We have an output file from the previous step. [Nautiyal_Dartmouth_Brain_Image_P3_Perievent_Analysis]
(_Avg_Cell_Traces_zNorm_Signal_||All_Trials||_|5s_bfr_Trial_Initi_End|-|5s_aft_Trial_Initi_End|_filtered_behav_added-DS1122-P6_3-S1-Sucrose-Reduced)

In this example, we are using that output file to plot time series data for cells that show: 

1. excitation to both trial initiation and delay period (code:  AT+_AD+)
2. no response to both trial initiation and delay period (code:  AT0_AD0)

On top right, it is showing timepoint-by-timepoint comparsions (unpaired permutation, alpha = 0.05) between the two cell types.

On bottom right, it is showing an unpaired permutation for examining differences in area under curve during the delay window period between the two cell types.
